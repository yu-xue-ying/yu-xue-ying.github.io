# Welcome to the Atmospheric Modeling & Remote Sensing Lab

We are atmospheric scientists at the [Atmospheric Sciences Research Center](https://www.albany.edu/asrc),  
[State University of New York at Albany](https://www.albany.edu/). Our research focuses on understanding the drivers of climate change, with an emphasis on greenhouse gases and air pollutants.

- **Quantify Emissions Across Scales**  
  We combine satellite observations, in-situ measurements, and advanced computational methods to quantify emissions from local to global levels. We also incorporate isotopic measurements to distinguish emission sources and sinks.

- **Leverage Next-Generation Satellites**  
  We utilize data from cutting-edge satellite missions to improve our understanding of trace gases. We integrate earth system science with machine learning and data assimilation to bridge critical knowledge gaps.

- **Support Climate Solutions**  
  Our work informs data-driven strategies for climate change mitigation through improved emissions tracking and source attribution.

**We are looking for highly motivated PhD students, postdocs, and visiting scholars. Please email me (xyu2@albany.edu) if you are interested.**
