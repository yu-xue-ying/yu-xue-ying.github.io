# About Our Research

We are atmospheric scientists at the [Atmospheric Sciences Research Center](https://www.albany.edu/asrc),  
[State University of New York at Albany](https://www.albany.edu/). Our research focuses on understanding the drivers of climate change, with an emphasis on greenhouse gases and air pollutants.

## What We Do

- **Quantify Emissions Across Scales**  
  We combine satellite observations, in-situ measurements, and advanced computational methods to quantify emissions from local to global levels.

- **Focus on Methane**  
  Methane is a key focus due to its potency as a greenhouse gas. We develop inverse modeling frameworks to constrain emissions from point sources to the global budget.

- **Leverage Next-Generation Satellites**  
  We utilize data from cutting-edge satellite missions to improve our understanding of methane sources and sinks.

- **Use Isotopic Fingerprints**  
  We incorporate δ¹³C-CH₄ and δD-CH₄ isotopic measurements to distinguish between biogenic, thermogenic, and pyrogenic methane sources.

- **Address Atmospheric Chemistry Uncertainties**  
  Our research accounts for the variability of atmospheric oxidants, especially OH, which strongly influences methane lifetime and emission estimates.

- **Apply Data Science and Machine Learning**  
  We integrate earth system science with machine learning and data assimilation to bridge critical knowledge gaps.

- **Support Climate Solutions**  
  Our work informs data-driven strategies for climate change mitigation through improved emissions tracking and source attribution.

**We are looking for highly motivated PhD students, postdocs, and visiting scholars. Please email me (xyu2@albany.edu) if you are interested.**
