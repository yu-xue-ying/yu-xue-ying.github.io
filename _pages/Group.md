<h2><strong>Xueying Yu</strong></h2>
<h3>Research Faculty</h3>
Email: xyu2@albany.edu
Office: ETEC 313
Ph.D.: University of Minnesota Twin Cities
Postdoc: Stanford University
Research Interest: Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Emissions, Bayesian Inversions
Bio: The goal of my research is to understand the drivers of climate change. Our work specifically focuses on greenhouse gases and air pollutants, to address critical knowledge gaps related to land-atmosphere-ocean exchange, climate-chemistry interactions, and their changes over time. We combine satellite and in-situ measurements to study the above issues over multiple scales. Specifically, we quantify methane emissions from point source level to the global budget. Our work also seeks to develop advanced computational methods for analyzing big data, for example by formulating novel inverse modeling approaches for leveraging the vast information provided by next-generation satellite data.
Yu's research focuses on using remote sensing observations along with earth system models and in-situ measurements to understand the source, chemical formation, and impacts of air pollution.
