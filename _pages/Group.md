<h3>Research Faculty</h3>
**Email:** xyu2@albany.edu  
**Office:** ETEC 313  
**Ph.D.:** University of Minnesota Twin Cities  
**Postdoc:** Stanford University  
**Research Interests:** Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Emissions, Bayesian Inversions  

**Bio:**  
The goal of my research is to understand the drivers of climate change. Our work specifically focuses on greenhouse gases and air pollutants to address critical knowledge gaps related to land-atmosphere-ocean exchange, climate-chemistry interactions, and their changes over time. We combine satellite and in-situ measurements to study these issues across multiple scales, with a focus on quantifying methane emissions from point sources to the global budget. Our group also develops advanced computational methods for analyzing big data, including novel inverse modeling approaches that leverage next-generation satellite observations.  
Yu's research integrates remote sensing, Earth system modeling, and ground-based observations to investigate the sources, formation, and impacts of air pollution.
