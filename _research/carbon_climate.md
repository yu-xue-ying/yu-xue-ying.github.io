We study the coupled interactions across biogenic/anthropogenic emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and the broader climate. Example works are diagnosing the [temperature and hydrological dependence of methane emissions](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/3325/2023/), evaluating the [sensitivity of the global methane budget to atmospheric oxidation](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/3325/2023/), and evaluating [the relationship between rainfall and NO2 emissions](https://arcg.is/0mHvyX0).

    <em><br>Simultaneous source + sink optimization using methane observations alone remains an ill-posed problem – even with the dense TROPOMI sampling coverage (Yu et al., 2023).</em>
